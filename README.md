# keynote-nord

A Keynote theme inspired by the [nord theme](https://www.nordtheme.com). The example
slides contain my workflow to setup fonts, colour and [LaTeXiT](https://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/) so as to obtain matching mathematical and text fonts.

You can use the theme by simply copying the example files, or installing the keynote
theme.

The theme has been tested in Keynote version 13.0.

If you like the colour palette, but do not want to use Apple keynote several beamer
themes inspired by nord colours exist, for instance
[beamerthemenord](https://github.com/junwei-wang/beamerthemeNord).

For the keynote theme, I have been inpsired mostly by the [sthlm beamer
theme](https://github.com/mholson/sthlmNordBeamerTheme).
